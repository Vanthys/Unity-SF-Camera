# Unity-SF-Camera
A simple "flying camera" for Unity using the new InputSystem. 

## "Install"
Drag and drop onto Camera

## Controls

| key | action |
| ------ | ------ |
| w/a/s/d | basic movement |
| shift | Makes camera accelerate |
| e/d | vertical movement |
| space | Moves camera on X and Z axis only.  So camera doesn't gain any height |
| right mouse button | Hold to change View  |

## Why is this here?
I originally found this code deep in a github discussion but forgot where. 
Since I had to rewrite the script so that it works with the new input system, as well as 
making some other QoL changes in the process, I figured it wouldn't hurt to post the new one somewhere.
